<m_s id="1" type="" n="1" /><m_e refid="1" />Welcome to Juxta!

<m_s id="14" type="" n="2" /><m_e refid="14" />To get started, you should download and read the PDF users' manual located in the "help" section of our home page:

<m_s id="88" type="" n="3" /><m_e refid="88" />http://www.patacriticism.org/juxta/

<m_s id="ad" type="" n="4" /><m_e refid="ad" />You can also examine some sample collations we've prepared.  Just select "Open Sample..." from the "File" menu of this application.  Any of the .jxt files contained therein will provide you with a playground for learning how Juxta works.

<m_s id="1c5" type="" n="5" /><m_e refid="1c5" />You can even learn a bit about the tool from this "welcome.jxt" comparison set.  It contains two versions of the text you're reading now.  Clicking on blue highlighted text reveals variants.  Explore Juxta by experimenting with other buttons and fields, such as the comparison view of documents, the "notes" field,  or the button for generating a critical apparatus.

<m_s id="335" type="" n="6" /><m_e refid="335" />When you are ready to collate your own documents, prepare them according to instructions in the users' manual and choose "New Comparison Set" from the "File" menu.

<m_s id="3da" type="" n="7" /><m_e refid="3da" />Have fun!</text>

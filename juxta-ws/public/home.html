<p>Juxta WS is a version of Juxta that runs as a web service.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org">Juxta</a> is a tool for
exploring differences between versions of a text. It allows the
scholar to collate witnesses with a base text during the editorial
process. It can be part of a workflow for checking OCRed or hand-keyed
texts, can help establish chronological or authorial relationships
between texts, and can track migrations of passages between texts.
</p>

<p>
Juxta WS is designed to work in the server environment of the digital
edition. Juxta WS allows you to upload and store XML documents for the
purpose of collation and display, and to browse collations using a
simple HTML interface.
</p>

<p>
As of this writing (mid-October 2011), Juxta WS can display the
differences between texts in two ways. The “Heatmap” view displays the
base text for a comparison set with spans highlighted in a range of
colors to indicate differences from the other witnesses (darker
highlighting indicates that a larger number of the witnesses vary).
The “Differences” view displays range offset data for the differences
among all the witnesses. A “Side by Side” view is planned for the
future; it will allow you to see two texts at a time with their
differences highlighted.
</p>

<p>
Juxta WS is made to be part of a production pipeline and may be
commanded using JSON or XML. The Juxta WS protocol follows a RESTful
model. It uses HTTP verbs to model CRUD operations on a set of
objects. The objects defined in this protocol include: comparison
sets, documents, tokens, collations (or alignments), analysis results,
and views. Objects created from each of these types are given an ID.
This ID may then be used to reference the object in subsequent
operations.
</p>

<p>
Juxta WS offers its operations both as an integrated whole and as
discrete operations or ‘micro-services’. For example, the tokenization
service may be called independently of other operations, allowing
Juxta WS to act as a pre-processor for linguistic algorithms. Or, you
may wish to intervene, process the token stream and then feed the
modified stream back into Juxta’s collation algorithm. These
micro-services conform to the Gothenburg Model developed in 2009 at a
joint workshop of the EU-funded research projects COST Action 32 and
Interedition in Gothenburg.
